Here in this project i have designed a Self Organizing Map which detects the potential Frauds while applying for a credit card.

SOMs are unsupervised learning methods which is widely used for Feature Detection.
SOMs may take a multi dimensional data sets which may have many rows and columns and they reduce the dimensionality of this data set I.e 
instead of having 100 rows and columns we will have a map so as the name Self Organizing Maps.
So we end up with 2 dimensional representation of the dataset. The point of the Som is to reduce the amount 
of columns from many columns into 2-dimension we will have in our 2 dimension output.
